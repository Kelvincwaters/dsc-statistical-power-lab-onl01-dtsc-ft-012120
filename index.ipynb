As you've seen, power analysis allows you to determine the sample size required to detect an effect of a given size with a given degree of confidence. In other words, it allows you to determine the probability of detecting an effect of a given size with a given level of confidence, under-sample size constraints.\n",

    "* **Power = 1 - P (Type II error)** = probability of finding an effect that is there\n",
